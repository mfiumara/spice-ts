# Benchmark sources

All benchmark material must identify its origin and redistribution terms. The
comparison harness runs the checked-in netlist unchanged in spice-ts and
ngspice; runner-added `.control` commands only export results and resource
statistics.

| Fixture(s) | Origin | Licence | Source / rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generated DC scaling resistor ladder (`benchmarks/performance/scaling-fixture.mjs`) | Original spice-ts fixture | MIT (repository licence) | Deterministically generated; the same byte-for-byte netlist is supplied to spice-ts and ngspice. No third-party circuit material is included. |
| `convergence/circuits/gmin-reverse-diode.cir` | Original spice-ts fixture | [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) | Authored for issue #56 to stress a nearly floating, reverse-biased nonlinear DC node. No third-party netlist was copied. |
| `convergence/circuits/source-step-bjt.cir` | Original spice-ts fixture | [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) | Authored for issue #56 to stress the nonlinear DC solve with a high-beta, low-emitter-resistance BJT. No third-party netlist was copied. |
| `convergence/circuits/timestep-diode-rectifier.cir` | Original spice-ts fixture | [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) | Authored for issue #56 to stress transient rejection at 1 ns diode-commutation edges. No third-party netlist was copied. |
