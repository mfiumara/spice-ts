# Aggregate 100-circuit parity report

This report publishes all outcomes, including failures and unsupported cases. It makes no speed or superiority claim.

## Reproduction

- Generate: `pnpm exec tsx benchmarks/aggregate-report.ts`
- Verify committed outcomes: `pnpm exec tsx benchmarks/aggregate-report.ts --check`
- Machine: Apple M5 Pro; darwin 27.0.0 arm64; Node v22.23.1
- Tools: spice-ts 0.3.0; ngspice-47; pnpm 10.28.1
- Deterministic outcome SHA-256 (host, timings, and error text excluded): `26be9f80744c077c0bdb98fa5c6c9cffc8615c2e2589383507abd59fd6fed41b`
- Aggregate fixture-tree SHA-256: `01b19fe5baf170d91aa5bd72c3ffb3891ed2f2c45cca5adfee8288552a7e14f1`.
- Source catalogue SHA-256: `b6540a743d176a01cc8e8aff6412655cc09f5fbf30554a53222c1d290c3029a1`.
- Runtime is one wall-clock sample per engine/fixture. Treat it as diagnostic data, not a performance comparison.

## Policy and totals

- Both engines receive the exact same fixture bytes; each row records the common SHA-256.
- No fixture adaptation and no per-circuit tolerance tuning.
- Accounted fixtures: 100 (ngspice=20, classic=20, xyce=20, corpus-d=20, corpus-e=20).
- ngspice: 52 success, 9 failed, 39 unsupported.
- spice-ts: 51 success, 3 failed, 46 unsupported.
- Matched-point errors: 54 analyses across 39 fixtures. Full per-signal max/RMS absolute and relative errors are in `benchmarks/aggregate-report.json`.
- Matched signals: 561 absolute (7959622 samples); 535 relative (7944908 samples, 14714 zero references excluded).
- Matched-point envelope (worst per signal): absolute max 1169140310571.719, absolute RMS 1169140310571.719, relative max 2110199067.731876, relative RMS 326930690.296368.
- Descriptive single-run runtime sums: ngspice 24921.976 ms; spice-ts 21912.135 ms.

## Transition from the previous accepted report

- Baseline: [issue #301](https://github.com/mfiumara/spice-ts/issues/301), [PR #312](https://github.com/mfiumara/spice-ts/pull/312), head `ac7dc9d8edf034bf35f589d078126ddb84224c82`, outcome `68b0a9edd25c1fc5c89644397dedfa8ba2b6ebcbd1c247463887f6d4fec44369`.
- Previous totals: ngspice 52/9/39 success/failed/unsupported; spice-ts 36/8/56; 40 analyses across 27 fixtures.
- Previous matched-point envelope: absolute max 1158.4523167631219, absolute RMS 693.3260545761561, relative max 739888253.1927755, relative RMS 326930690.296368.
- spiceTs `ngspice/mos6-inverter-transient`: failed → success. Accepted MOS model-card, capacitance, and Newton-step handling lets the declared transient analysis converge.
- spiceTs `ngspice/mos-amplifier-transient`: failed → success. Accepted MOS model-card, capacitance, and Newton-step handling lets the declared transient analysis converge.
- spiceTs `classic/mos6-inverter-chain`: failed → success. Accepted MOS model-card, capacitance, and Newton-step handling lets the declared transient analysis converge.
- spiceTs `classic/mos-amplifier`: failed → success. Accepted MOS model-card, capacitance, and Newton-step handling lets the declared transient analysis converge.
- spiceTs `classic/mos-memory-cell`: failed → success. Accepted MOS model-card, capacitance, and Newton-step handling lets the declared transient analysis converge.
- spiceTs `ngspice/rc-lowpass-ac`: unsupported → success. Accepted report-only POST option handling removes the parser rejection and both declared analyses complete.
- spiceTs `ngspice/vbic-common-emitter-ac`: unsupported → success. Accepted classic pole-zero result emission supplies the previously missing declared analysis.
- spiceTs `classic/pole-zero-four-stage`: unsupported → success. Accepted classic pole-zero result emission supplies the previously missing declared analysis.
- spiceTs `classic/pole-zero-three-stage`: unsupported → success. Accepted classic pole-zero result emission supplies the previously missing declared analysis.
- spiceTs `classic/high-pass-pole-zero`: unsupported → success. Accepted classic pole-zero result emission supplies the previously missing declared analysis.
- spiceTs `ngspice/schmitt-trigger`: unsupported → success. Accepted classic BJT Q-card parsing removes the OFF-form parser rejection and transient analysis completes.
- spiceTs `classic/ecl-schmitt-trigger`: unsupported → success. Accepted classic BJT Q-card parsing removes the OFF-form parser rejection and transient analysis completes.
- spiceTs `xyce/capacitor-rc-oscillator`: unsupported → success. Accepted V() and I() output-function handling removes expression evaluation failures and transient analysis completes.
- spiceTs `xyce/diode-transient`: unsupported → success. Accepted V() and I() output-function handling removes expression evaluation failures and transient analysis completes.
- spiceTs `xyce/rlc-transient`: unsupported → success. Accepted V() and I() output-function handling removes expression evaluation failures and transient analysis completes.
- Comparable coverage increased from 40 analyses across 27 fixtures to 54 analyses across 39 fixtures.
- MOS convergence added five transient comparisons; classic BJT Q-card parsing added two transient comparisons; POST handling added AC and operating-point comparisons for rc-lowpass-ac.
- Pole-zero result emission added four pole-zero comparisons. V() and I() output-function handling made three Xyce fixtures successful, while only rlc-transient exposed common signals for a new comparison.
- Matched coverage increased from 371 to 561 absolute signals and from 349 to 535 relative signals. Absolute samples increased from 7,455,070 to 7,959,622; relative samples increased from 7,451,932 to 7,944,908; excluded zero references increased from 3,138 to 14,714.
- The expanded comparison set raised the worst per-signal absolute max from 1158.4523167631219 to 1169140310571.719 and absolute RMS from 693.3260545761561 to 1169140310571.719.
- The expanded comparison set raised the worst per-signal relative max from 739888253.1927755 to 2110199067.731876; relative RMS remained 326930690.296368.
