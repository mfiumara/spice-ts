# Aggregate 100-circuit parity report

This report publishes all outcomes, including failures and unsupported cases. It makes no speed or superiority claim.

## Reproduction

- Generate: `pnpm exec tsx benchmarks/aggregate-report.ts`
- Verify committed outcomes: `pnpm exec tsx benchmarks/aggregate-report.ts --check`
- Machine: Apple M5 Pro; darwin 27.0.0 arm64; Node v22.23.1
- Tools: spice-ts 0.3.0; ngspice-47; pnpm 10.28.1
- Deterministic outcome SHA-256 (host, timings, and error text excluded): `05a0675e6e948ac23959c6804fcf91782035823f074f52336a0ca8983942f68a`
- Aggregate fixture-tree SHA-256: `9bea16d967510fe868e68bfad672b02b477802d63bfe191660d4a0a737602cba`.
- Source catalogue SHA-256: `b6540a743d176a01cc8e8aff6412655cc09f5fbf30554a53222c1d290c3029a1`.
- Runtime is one wall-clock sample per engine/fixture. Treat it as diagnostic data, not a performance comparison.

## Policy and totals

- Both engines receive the exact same fixture bytes; each row records the common SHA-256.
- No fixture adaptation and no per-circuit tolerance tuning.
- Accounted fixtures: 100 (ngspice=20, classic=20, xyce=20, corpus-d=20, corpus-e=20).
- ngspice: 52 success, 9 failed, 39 unsupported.
- spice-ts: 28 success, 9 failed, 63 unsupported.
- Matched-point errors: 28 analyses across 18 fixtures. Full per-signal max/RMS absolute and relative errors are in `benchmarks/aggregate-report.json`.
- Matched signals: 253 absolute (7413027 samples); 235 relative (7410627 samples, 2400 zero references excluded).
- Matched-point envelope (worst per signal): absolute max 90.09458674829554, absolute RMS 59.660512653520904, relative max 273625086.91875815, relative RMS 131055144.90676585.
- Descriptive single-run runtime sums: ngspice 10149.156 ms; spice-ts 7401.295 ms.

## Transition from the previous accepted report

- Baseline: [issue #275](https://github.com/mfiumara/spice-ts/issues/275), [PR #284](https://github.com/mfiumara/spice-ts/pull/284), head `47da214e26d348f41baea47b80acff8afe6f2881`, outcome `2c5abd0d6ffb637d98ef8a9248ce2007932b0b211064a6445175fc3bb9056ba8`.
- Previous totals: ngspice 52/9/39 success/failed/unsupported; spice-ts 28/9/63; 28 analyses across 18 fixtures.
- Previous matched-point envelope: absolute max 90.09458674829554, absolute RMS 59.660512653520904, relative max 273625086.91875815, relative RMS 131055144.90676585.
- Status transitions: none. Both engines retained every prior success, failure, and unsupported classification.
- Comparable coverage is unchanged at 28 analyses across 18 fixtures; the bounded voltage-input pole-zero merge did not make an existing aggregate fixture newly comparable.
- Matched coverage is unchanged at 253 absolute signals over 7,413,027 samples and 235 relative signals over 7,410,627 samples, with 2,400 exact-zero references excluded.
- The matched-point envelope is unchanged: absolute max 90.09458674829554, absolute RMS 59.660512653520904, relative max 273625086.91875815, and relative RMS 131055144.90676585.
