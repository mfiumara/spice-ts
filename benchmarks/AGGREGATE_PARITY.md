# Aggregate 100-circuit parity report

This report publishes all outcomes, including failures and unsupported cases. It makes no speed or superiority claim.

## Reproduction

- Generate: `pnpm exec tsx benchmarks/aggregate-report.ts`
- Verify committed outcomes: `pnpm exec tsx benchmarks/aggregate-report.ts --check`
- Machine: Apple M5 Pro; darwin 27.0.0 arm64; Node v22.23.1
- Tools: spice-ts 0.3.0; ngspice-47; pnpm 10.28.1
- Deterministic outcome SHA-256 (host, timings, and error text excluded): `e2b15a758ba50429c26fd5ae3f1ac3a485a93f143223c0d7ba8e24710759a5b5`
- Runtime is one wall-clock sample per engine/fixture. Treat it as diagnostic data, not a performance comparison.

## Policy and totals

- Both engines receive the exact same fixture bytes; each row records the common SHA-256.
- No fixture adaptation and no per-circuit tolerance tuning.
- Accounted fixtures: 100 (ngspice=20, classic=20, xyce=20, corpus-d=20, corpus-e=20).
- ngspice: 52 success, 9 failed, 39 unsupported.
- spice-ts: 11 success, 6 failed, 83 unsupported.
- Matched-point errors: 16 analyses across 10 fixtures. Full per-signal max/RMS absolute and relative errors are in `benchmarks/aggregate-report.json`.
