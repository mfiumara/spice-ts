# Aggregate 60-circuit parity report

This report publishes all outcomes, including failures and unsupported cases. It makes no speed or superiority claim.

## Reproduction

- Generate: `pnpm exec tsx benchmarks/aggregate-report.ts`
- Verify committed outcomes: `pnpm exec tsx benchmarks/aggregate-report.ts --check`
- Machine: Apple M5 Pro; darwin 27.0.0 arm64; Node v22.23.1
- Tools: spice-ts 0.3.0; ngspice-47; pnpm 10.28.1
- Deterministic outcome SHA-256 (timings excluded): `424c6ab34bcb82dab3bee4d310be59d0b78ca2cde2b31c6d226bab343fd9442e`
- Runtime is one wall-clock sample per engine/fixture. Treat it as diagnostic data, not a performance comparison.

## Policy and totals

- Both engines receive the exact same fixture bytes; each row records the common SHA-256.
- No fixture adaptation and no per-circuit tolerance tuning.
- Accounted fixtures: 60 (ngspice=20, classic=20, xyce=20).
- ngspice: 47 success, 6 failed, 7 unsupported.
- spice-ts: 1 success, 0 failed, 59 unsupported.
- Matched-point errors: 2 analyses across 1 fixtures. Full per-signal max/RMS absolute and relative errors are in `benchmarks/aggregate-report.json`.

Every unsupported or failed spice-ts row is a published loss. Engine error strings, input hashes, commands, signal lists, point counts, and matched-point metrics are retained in the JSON report.
