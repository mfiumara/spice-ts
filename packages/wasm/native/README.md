# Dense numeric WebAssembly artifact

`dense-solver.wasm` is the checked-in numeric kernel used by the bounded `spice-ts-wasm` backend. Package builds copy and hash this artifact. They do not require a native compiler and do not regenerate it implicitly.

The artifact was built with Homebrew LLVM/LLD 23.1.3:

    PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/lld/bin:$PATH" \
      clang --target=wasm32 -Oz -nostdlib -fno-builtin \
      -Wl,--no-entry \
      -Wl,--export=stamp_vccs_f64 \
      -Wl,--export=solve_f64 \
      -Wl,--export=solve_complex_f64 \
      -Wl,--export=abi_version \
      -Wl,--export=max_order \
      -Wl,--export=__heap_base \
      -Wl,--export-memory \
      -Wl,--initial-memory=196608 \
      -Wl,--max-memory=196608 \
      -Wl,--strip-all \
      -o native/dense-solver.wasm native/dense-solver.c

Expected artifact:

- byte length: 3275
- SHA-256: `9521611634a21cd44771ffb76f0ac70b3f0bdd3df6f03f3828264c72238c7137`
- imports: none
- memory: fixed at 3 WebAssembly pages (196608 bytes)
- ABI version: 2
- maximum order: 64

ABI v2 exposes `stamp_vccs_f64(order, matrix, outP, outN, ctrlP, ctrlN, gm)` for bounded linear VCCS stamps,
`solve_f64(order, matrix, rhs)` for real systems, and
`solve_complex_f64(order, matrixReal, matrixImaginary, rhsReal, rhsImaginary)` for split-complex systems.
The entry points mutate their row-major matrices and right-hand sides in place. Status 0 means success, 1 means
singular, 2 means non-finite input/intermediate/output, and 3 means invalid arguments.

The kernels perform deterministic dense f64 Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. Equal pivot magnitudes
retain the lowest row index. The complex kernel uses scaled division and a `max(abs(real), abs(imaginary))` pivot
score. It has no WASI, filesystem, network, clock, randomness, shared memory, threads, SIMD, or memory growth.
